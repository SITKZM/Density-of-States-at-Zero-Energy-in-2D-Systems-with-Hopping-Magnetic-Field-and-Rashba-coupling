# Density-of-States-at-Zero-Energy-in-2D-Systems-with-Hopping-Magnetic-Field-and-Rashba-coupling
<About>

This is the program to calculate DOS at zero energy states when moving magnetic field and Rashba spin-orbit coupling.

The Hamiltonian is of 2-dimentional metals when adding magnetic field h_z, and Rashba spin-orbit interaction.[1]



<Hop file>

You have to prepare the hopping indices and the unit vector in the direction.

The included hop.txt is the example. When the electron hopps from site j to site i, and the direction are x_ij, and y_ij, you write the file as follows:

i    j    x_ij    y_ij


The example file is for one of Penrose approximants.
